Q1: How AI-driven code generation tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) reduce development time. What are their limitations?
Reduction in Development Time:

Code Autocompletion: AI tools suggest real-time code snippets, reducing manual typing and boilerplate code writing.

Faster Debugging: They help identify and fix common errors quickly.

Learning Assistance: Developers can quickly learn new languages/frameworks by relying on AI-generated examples.

Reduced Context Switching: Automating repetitive tasks allows developers to focus on complex logic.

Limitations:

Code Quality & Security Risks: AI may generate inefficient, insecure, or outdated code.

Over-Reliance: Developers might accept incorrect suggestions without proper review.

Limited Understanding: AI lacks deep contextual awareness of business logic.

Licensing Issues: Generated code may unintentionally replicate copyrighted snippets.

Q2: Compare supervised and unsupervised learning in the context of automated bug detection.
Aspect	Supervised Learning	Unsupervised Learning
Data Requirements	Needs labeled bug/non-bug datasets.	Works with raw, unlabeled code.
Detection Approach	Classifies known bug patterns (e.g., null pointer exceptions).	Identifies anomalies or unusual code patterns.
Accuracy	High for known bugs but limited to training data.	Can detect novel bugs but may produce false positives.
Use Case	Best for repetitive, well-documented bugs.	Useful for discovering new, unexpected bugs.

Q3: Why is bias mitigation critical when using AI for user experience personalization?
Fairness & Inclusivity: Bias can exclude or misrepresent certain user groups (e.g., gender, race, or location-based discrimination).

Reputation Risk: Biased recommendations can lead to PR backlash and loss of user trust (e.g., AI favoring premium users over free-tier users).

Legal Compliance: Regulations (e.g., GDPR, AI Act) require fairness in automated decision-making.

Business Impact: Biased personalization can reduce engagement and revenue by providing irrelevant or offensive content.

2. Case Study Analysis: AI in DevOps â€“ Automating Deployment Pipelines
Key Benefits of AI in DevOps Deployment Pipelines:
Automated Testing & QA: AI predicts test cases, detects flaky tests, and prioritizes critical failures.

Anomaly Detection in Deployments: ML models monitor logs/metrics to detect deployment failures early.

Predictive Scaling: AI forecasts traffic spikes and auto-scales infrastructure.

Self-Healing Systems: AI-driven rollbacks or fixes reduce downtime.

Challenges:
Data Dependency: AI requires high-quality historical deployment data.

False Positives: Over-alerting can lead to "alert fatigue."

Integration Complexity: Legacy systems may not support AI-driven automation.

Future Trends:
AI-Ops Integration: Combining AI with observability tools for smarter incident response.

Explainable AI (XAI): Making AI-driven decisions transparent for compliance.
